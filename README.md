# PetTrack - A Lost and Found App for Pets

The Problem: The Agony of a Lost Pet/Losing a pet is a deeply stressful experience for any owner. Current methods are fragmented: scattered posts on social media, physical flyers, and calls to local shelters. This process is slow, inefficient, and relies heavily on luck, while time is critical.

Our Solution: PetTrack; A dedicated, centralized platform for lost and found pets. PetTrack leverages technology to connect pet owners with finders in the community quickly and efficiently. Our mission is to reduce the time pets are separated from their families by providing smart, location-aware tools.
